<body bgcolor="white">

<p class="changed_added_2_0">Public classes for the Java code API of
Facelets.  The vast majority of Facelets users have no need to access
the Java API and can get all their work done using the tag-level
API.</p>

<p>PENDING: more classes will be added to this package before final
release of JSF 2.0.</p>
