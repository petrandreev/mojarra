WARNING:  

 -- Do *not* edit the "*-attrs.xml" files by hand.  They should
    be recreated (by running "ant attributes") whenever a change is made to
    one of the corresponding "*-props.xml" files.

 -- If any changes are made to any of the included documents or
    to standard-html-renderkit-base.xml, call the ant
    target 'create.standard.xml' to recreate standard-html-renderkit.xml.
    The OS utility xmllint must be present on the system when the
    target is called.
