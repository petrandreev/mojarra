                By default, a view action is not executed on
                postback. If your application is decidedly stateless,
                you may need the view action to execute on any type of
                request. The default value is false.

                You may only want the view action to be invoked under certain conditions. 
                For that, you can use this property, which accepts an EL value expression
                that must evaluate to a boolean value.

                Specifies the phase in which the action invocation should occur 
                using the name of the phase constant in the PhaseId class (the case does 
                not matter). The default is INVOKE_APPLICATION.
