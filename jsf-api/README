			     JSR #000127
		  Java Server Faces 1.0

This README covers the jsf-api and jsf-ri workspaces.

The key goal for the Java Server Faces project is to build a UI
framework which can easily be embraced by tools in order to draw a
larger development base to Java server application development.

Milestone 1 Release notes:

At the completion of Milestone 1, we have:

1. An abstract RenderKit framework

2. A concrete implementation of a RenderKit for HTML,
   with Renderers for WForm, WOutput, WCommand and
   WSelectBoolean

3. A mechanism for advertising and plugging in this
   concrete implementation to the abstract framework.

4. WComponent sub-classes for the above
   Renderers.

What we learned during the construction of M1:

During the construction of this milestone, we encountered some problems
with the way the JSF-API handled bootstrapping.  These problems were
resolved by following the pattern used in JAXP for connecting the a JSR
interface to its implementation in a pluggable way.

We learned how to create a custom tag lib, install it in a web-app.  We
got a good feel for the problem space.

We came upon a "chicken and egg" problem regarding the construction and
initialization of the RenderContext: It's not possible to fully
construct and initialize a RenderContext using the factory method
without exposing some JSP specific data.  Our solution to this problem
is to force the user of the RenderContext to create an instance with a
factory method, then initialize it.  See
<jsf-ri/src/com/sun/faces/taglib/html_basic/UseFacesTag.java.doStartTag()>.
This solution may need revisiting.
