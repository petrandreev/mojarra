Licensee must restrict access to Confidential Information to its

be corrected by Sun.&nbsp; Licensee will hold Sun harmless from any
claims based on Licensee's use of the Licensed Software for any

law,&nbsp; neither party will be liable for any indirect, punitive,
special, incidental or consequential damage in connection with or

this Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S.
Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor
(at any tier), then the Government's rights in the Software and
accompanying documentation shall be only as set forth in this
license; this is in accordance with 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-4 (for
Department of Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with 48 C.F.R. 2.101
and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions). 
</P>
<P><B>11.0 GENERAL TERMS</B> <BR>11.1 Any action relating to or

as may be required after delivery to Licensee. <BR>11.3 It is
understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, Licensee's breach of the provisions of Section 7 of
this Agreement will cause Sun irreparable damage for which recovery
of money damages would be inadequate, and that Sun will therefore be
entitled to seek timely injunctive relief to protect Sun's rights
under this Agreement in addition to any and all remedies available at
law. <BR>11.4 Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer any of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of the other party, except that Sun may assign this
Agreement to an affiliated company. <BR>11.5 This Agreement is the
parties' entire agreement relating to its subject matter.&nbsp; It
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written
communications, proposals, conditions, representations and warranties
and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote,
order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties
relating to its subject matter during the term of this Agreement.&nbsp;
No modification to this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing
and signed by an authorized representative of each party.</P>
