For testing the build with v2, simply run 

update build.properties to point to the correct directory
container.name=glassfish
container.home=/glassfish/home/directory
make sure that password.txt is found in container.home
ant test.with.container.refresh
-or-
start glassfish (asadmin start-domain)
ant build.and.deploy # make sure that you'll actually test the changes
ant test

For testing the build with v3:
Quicklook tests:
ant build.and.deploy
checkout v3
cd tests/quicklook
mvn -Dglassfish.home=/home/glassfish/dir test

JSF tests:
Be sure to install glassfish with a password on admin
make sure that password.txt is found in container.home
container.name=glassfishV3
container.home=/glassfish/home/directory
home may be one level down in standard distro (glassfish/glassfish)
ant test.with.container.refresh
-or-
start glassfish (asadmin start-domain)
ant main container.deploy # make sure that you'll actually test the changes
ant test



If you want to test locally without having to rely on an RE build, here is what you can do.

cd ${MOJARRA_2.0_REPO}
ant -Dbuild.number=b10 -Dbuild.type=BETA1 clean main
cd jsf-api && ant -Dbuild.number=b10 -Dbuild.type=BETA1 mvn.deploy.promoted.local && cd ..
cd jsf-ri && ant -Dbuild.number=b10 -Dbuild.type=BETA1 mvn.deploy.promoted.local && cd ..

This will produce the same result as what RE would produce so that the version strings, etc
can all be verified.

After running these steps you should be able to ls:

    ~/.m2/repository/com/sun/faces/jsf-api/2.0.0-b10/jsf-api-2.0.0-b10.jar
    ~/.m2/repository/com/sun/faces/jsf-impl/2.0.0-b10/jsf-impl-2.0.0-b10.jar


Update your v3/pom.xml to refer to the new build.
Build V3, and unpack the glassfish distribution (i.e. distributions/target/glassfish).
Run the quicklook tests per usual.
