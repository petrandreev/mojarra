    <description>
        <![CDATA[<p class="changed_added_2_2">The presence of an <br />
        attribute from this namespace on an otherwise non-JSF aware<br />
        markup element indicates that the markup element must be treated<br />
        as a JSF component that will be rendered equivalently to what is<br />
        specified directly in the Facelet page, with the added benefit<br />
        of being associated with a server side <code>UIComponent</code><br />
        instance.

        </p>

        <div class="changed_added_2_2">

        <p>Usage example</p>

        <code><pre>
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xmlns:jsf="http://java.sun.com/jsf"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lth:form&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;input name="textField" type="text" jsf:value="#{bean.name}" /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt/h:form&gt;<br />
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></code>

        <p>When the Facelets runtime detects an attribute from the<br />
        http://java.sun.com/jsf namespace, the entire element must be<br />
        set to be in that namespace by a call to<br />
        <code>Tag.setNamespace()</code>.  A<br />
        component-family/renderer-type pairing must be derived based on<br />
        the XML local name of the element as shown in the following<br />
        table.</p>

        <table border="1">
 
        <tr>

           <th>XML local name</th> <th>component-family</th> <th>renderer-type</th>

        </tr>

        <tr>

          <td>input</td> <td>javax.faces.Input</td> <td>javax.faces.passthrough.Input</td>

        </tr>
 
        </table>

        <p>The components's attribute map must be given an entry with<br />
        the key given by the value of the constant<br />
        <code>javax.faces.render.Renderer.PASSTHROUGH_RENDERER_LOCALNAME_KEY</code><br />
        and the value given by the XML local name.  Any non-namespaced<br />
        attributes on the markup element must be set exactly as they<br />
        appear on the pass through attribute map of the component.  Any<br />
        attributes from namespace http://java.sun.com/jsf must be set as<br />
        properties on the component in the usual manner for other<br />
        regular JSF components.</p><br />

        <p>Names and Client Ids</p>

        <ul>

        <p>The following algorithm must be used to set the id (and<br />
        therefore the clientId) of the component corresponding to this<br />
        markup.</p>

        <p>If the element has a manually declared, non-namespaced "id"<br />
        attribute, us it as the id.  Otherwise, if the element has an<br />
        "id" attribute in the http://java.sun.com/jsf namespace, use it<br />
        as the id.  Otherwise, if the element has been set as being in<br />
        the http://java.sun.com/jsf namespace, and has a "name"<br />
        attribute, use it as the id.</p>

        </ul>

        <p>The system must throw a <code>FaceletException</code> if an<br />
        attribute from this namespace is used on a regular JSF aware<br />
        markup element.</p>
