        <description>
            A validator that uses the pattern attribute to validate the wrapping
            component.  The entire pattern is matched against the String value
            of the component.  If it matches, it's valid.

            <description>
                A regular expression pattern.  Remember that, like in all Java
                strings, backslash must be escaped with another backslash.  
                Additionally, to use #{ in a regex, it must also be escaped, since
                it will otherwise be interpreted as an EL expression.

        <description>
            A validator that checks a credit card number to see that it's valid, 
            using the Luhn Algorithm.  The credit card number may only have numbers,
            as well as dashes and spaces, which are ignored.
