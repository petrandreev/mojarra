This README documents the Sun Reference implementation (RI) for JSR 127,
JavaServer (tm) Faces.

jsf-api cvs tag for this implementation: JSF_API_20020730B

Major changes/features in this release:
=======================================

* Saving the tree can be done either in session (server) or in page by
  turning off/on context parameter "saveStateInClient". Default is server. 
  All objects referenced must be serializable if save state in page option 
  is used.

* Basic L10N support has been enabled by integrating with JSTL
  <fmt:setBundle> tag. There is a dependency on jstl.jar and standard.jar
  due to this feature.


Known Issues With This Release
==============================

* When saving tree in session, we don't support multiple concurrent
  requests to faces app from one client.

* SaveState in page option cannot be used if your web app has 
  event handlers and validators because they are not serializable 
  currently.

*  Components are instantiated on each request.
   Fix:

*  Component type is hard coded in component subclasses (ex: UICommand)
   as fully qualfied class names (ex: javax.faces.component.UICommand).
   However, a component's type is configurable in the renderkit's xml 
   configuration file (HtmlBasicRenderKit.xml).

*  AttributeDescriptor support happens all the time, even though it's
   only used at design time.

* HyperLink tags don't work as expected in sample "Basic" application. 
  This is because once the response tree is set to target, we need to
  jump to render response phase which we are unable to do at this time.
