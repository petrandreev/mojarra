Major changes/features in this release:
=======================================

* XUL file goes away.  The tree is now built during the
  RenderResponsePhase and saved in the session.

* CreateRequestTree phase removed.  Lots of action now takes place in
  ReconstituteRequestTreePhase.

* Fixed Bug in HandleRequestEvents where all events wouldn't get
  processed if any handler returned true.

* Change ProcessValidationsPhase to be spec compliant.

* Changed case of JSP tags and attributes.

Known Issues With This Release
==============================

* Saving the tree in the session is a big problem.  Currently we don't
  support multiple concurrent requests to faces app from one client.

*  Components are instantiated on each request.
   Fix:

*  Component type is hard coded in component subclasses (ex: UICommand)
   as fully qualfied class names (ex: javax.faces.component.UICommand).
   However, a component's type is configurable in the renderkit's xml 
   configuration file (HtmlBasicRenderKit.xml).

*  AttributeDescriptor support happens all the time, even though it's
   only used at design time.
