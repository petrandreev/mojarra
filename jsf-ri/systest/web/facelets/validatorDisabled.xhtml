    Test 1.  Validate nested validators marked as disabled aren't processed.
</p>
<h:form id="form1">
    <h:inputText id="input" value="#{requestScope.value}">
        <f:validateLongRange maximum="10" disabled="true" />
        <f:validateLength minimum="5" />
        <f:validateDoubleRange minimum="5" disabled="true" />
    </h:inputText>
        <br />
        <h:commandButton id="sub" value="Submit" />
        <h:messages id="messages1" for="input" />
</h:form>
<p>
    Test 2.  Nested validator disable status takes precedence over wrapped validators.
    First input field disables the validator, so no messages should appear over the
    HR.  The second field doesn't have a validator.  Surrounding both fields is
    a length validator with a minimum of 5.
</p>
<h:form id="form2">
    <f:validateLength minimum="5">
        <h:inputText id="input1" value="#{requestScope.value1}">
            <f:validateLength disabled="true" />
        </h:inputText>
        <h:inputText id="input2" value="#{requestScope.value2}" />
    </f:validateLength>
    <h:commandButton id="sub" value="Submit" />
    <h:messages id="messages2" for="input1" />
    <hr />
    <h:messages id="messages3" for="input2" />
