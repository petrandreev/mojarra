    <h1>RoR Flash Test Page 2</h1>

  <p>As mentioned in the previous page, if I wanted to store something
  in the flash during this request and also access it during this
  request, <code>\#{flash.now.bar}</code> is the way to do it.  In
  reality, this just puts the value in request scope, but that's what
  "now" is, anyway.</p>

  <h:form prependId="false" id="form1">

  <h:panelGrid columns="2" border="1">

  <f:verbatim>
    Value of the previous request's foo
  </f:verbatim>

    <h:outputText id="flash2FooValueId" value="#{flash.foo}" />

  <f:verbatim>
    Put <code>barValue</code> in the flash.now under key
    <code>bar</code>.
  </f:verbatim>

    <c:set target="#{flash.now}" property="bar" value="barValue" />

    <f:verbatim>
      c:set target="\#{flash.now}" property="bar" value="barValue"
    </f:verbatim>

  <f:verbatim>
    Value of <code>\#{flash.now.bar}</code>, should be <code>barValue</code>.
  </f:verbatim>

    <h:outputText id="flash2BarValueId" value="#{flash.now.bar}" />

    <h:commandButton value="reload"  id="reload" />
