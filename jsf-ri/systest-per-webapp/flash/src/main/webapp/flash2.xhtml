    <h1>RoR Flash Test Page 2</h1>

  <p>As mentioned in the previous page, if I wanted to store something
  in the flash during this request and also access it during this
  request, <code>\#{flash.now.bar}</code> is the way to do it.  In
  reality, this just puts the value in request scope, but that's what
  "now" is, anyway.</p>

  <h:form id="form1">

  <h:panelGrid columns="2" border="1">

  <f:verbatim>
    Value of the previous request's foo
  </f:verbatim>

    <h:outputText value="#{flash.foo}" />

  <f:verbatim>
    Put <code>barValue</code> in the flash.now under key
    <code>bar</code>.
  </f:verbatim>

    <c:set var="#{flash.now.bar}" value="barValue" />

    <f:verbatim>
      c:set var="flash.now.bar" value="barValue"
    </f:verbatim>

  <f:verbatim>
    Value of <code>flash.now.bar</code>, should be <code>barValue</code>.
  </f:verbatim>

    <h:outputText value="#{flash.now.bar}" />

    <h:commandButton value="reload" />

    <h:commandButton value="back" action="back" />

    &nbsp;

    <h:commandButton value="next" action="next" />

   </h:panelGrid>

  </h:form>
