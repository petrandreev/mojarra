<p> JavaServer<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> Faces technology
simplifies building user interfaces for JavaServer applications. With
the well-defined programming model that JavaServer Faces technology
provides, developers of various skill levels can quickly and easily
build web applications that handle all of the complexity of managing
the user interface on the server, allowing the application developer to
focus on application code. </p>
<p> JavaServer Faces technology includes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>A set of APIs and reference implementation that provide: user
interface components, model object management, pluggable rendering,
server side
validation, data conversion, event processing, page flow management,
and
custom extensibility for all of these things.</li>
  <li>A JavaServer Pages (JSP) custom tag library for expressing a
JavaServer Faces interface within a JSP page.</li>
