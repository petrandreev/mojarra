<center> <b>Specification Version:</b> 1.2 Public Final Draft (PFD)
Release<br>
<b>Reference Implementation (RI) Version:</b> 1.2<br>
</center>
<p> This release of JavaServer Faces technology includes the following
examples.&nbsp; To build the examples see the <a
 href="https://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/faq.html#Code_build">building
instructions</a> on java.net.&nbsp; To deploy the examples using <a
 href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/">glassfish</a>, drop the
example's WAR file into the <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;glassfish_home&gt;/domains/domain1/autodeploy</span>
directory.&nbsp; The descriptions of each example on this page include
the URL to run the example.&nbsp; The <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;hostname&gt;</span> part of the
URL is the host where the server is running and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;port&gt;</span> is the port for
requests.<br>

  <dl>
    <dt><b>cardemo</b></dt>
    <dd>An online car store, localized in American English, French,
German and Latin American Spanish. This application is a
proof-of-concept application, which demonstrates that JavaServer Faces
technology can be used to build industrial-strength Web applications.
It is not intended to be representative of best practices for Web
application design. To run the sample, visit <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">http://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/</span><hostname><port><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">jsf-cardemo.</span><br>
      </port></hostname></dd>
  </dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> <b>components</b><br>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> A set of custom components. This
application shows how to
build various custom components with JavaServer Faces technology. To
run the sample, visit <code>http://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/</code><hostname><port><code>jsf-components.</code></port></hostname><br>
  <hostname><port> </port></hostname></div>

<blockquote>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>guessNumber</b></dt>
    <dd> Duke is thinking of a number. Can you guess it? This simple
application shows a small set of standard components, page navigation,
and validation. To run the sample, visit <code>http://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/</code><hostname><port><code>jsf-guessNumber.</code><br>
      </port></hostname></dd>

<blockquote>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>renderkits</b></dt>
    <dd>Demonstrates how to create and use a
custom render kit and shows how easy it is to utilize multiple render
kits in one application. <br>
This example must be run with the Mozilla <a
 href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/deerpark/releases/alpha2.html">Deer
Park Alpha 2</a> browser because this browser supports SVG.&nbsp; Once
you have launched this browser, run
the sample by visiting <code>http://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/jsf-renderkits</code><hostname><port><code>.<br>
      <br>
      </code></port></hostname></dd>
    <dt><b>webtier sample</b></dt>
    <dd>A simple application demonstrating
JavaServer Faces technology inter-operating JSTL, JSP. To run the
sample, visit <code>http://</code><hostname><port><code>webtier-sample.</code></port></hostname></dd>
