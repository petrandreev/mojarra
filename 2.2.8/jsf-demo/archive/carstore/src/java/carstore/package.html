<p>CarStore is a moderately complex demonstration of JavaServer Faces
    technology. Please consult the tutorial for more detailed information
    on the concepts required to build applications with JavaServer Faces
    technology. Below we use whiteboard diagrams to illustrate the ease
    with which a web application can be designed, and how that design can be
    easily cast into a Faces application.</p>

<h3>Page Flow</h3>

<p>Here's a quick diagram of page flow through the application.</p>

<p><img src="@context.path@/javadocs/flow.jpg"/></p>

<p>Each box corresponds to a JSP page. The arrows correspond to the
    <b>supported</b> flow from page to page, either with buttons in the
    page, or with the browser navigation buttons.</p>

<h3>Supporting Beans</h3>

<p>We then overlay the beans required to back the JSP pages.</p>

<p><img src="@context.path@/javadocs/beans.jpg"/></p>

<p>See the JavaDocs for each bean to see what it does.</p>

<h3>Back End Data</h3>

<p>Finally, we add the back end data. In this simple application, the
    data is read from <code>java.util.ResourceBundle</code> instances, but
    it could just as well come from a database.</p>
