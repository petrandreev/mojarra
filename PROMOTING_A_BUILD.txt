Instructions on promoting a build:

Engineering finishes JSF2.0 code.

Engineering verifies QL passes
checkout v3 workspace.
cd v3/tests/quicklook

Engineering updates updatecenter2/conf/jsf_proto.py to correct version #.

Tag build.


RE (Omar) promotes build, pushes to http:eflat.sfbay:40000
Change variables found in common.xml (build.type, etc) via -D as part of build
    build.type will be set to a value such as BETA, RC, FCS, etc.
    build.number will be a monotonically increasing integer, incremented for each build.
See instructions in updatecenter2/README for the push to eflat.
    You'll need to set the IPS package number in updatecenter/conf/jsf_proto.conf to match
    the build number, with the final number segment being numeric only with no leading zeros.

QE runs qualification tests, against eflat (JSF2.0)
    and epine (current GFv3), comfirms they pass.

QE gives go-ahead.

RE (Terena) pushes eflat and epine to external sites.
