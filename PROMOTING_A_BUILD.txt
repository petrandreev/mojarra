Instructions on promoting a build:

Engineering finishes JSF2.0 code.

Ensure all tests pass via:
ant clean main test.with.container.refresh

Engineering verifies QL passes
checkout v3 workspace.
cd v3/tests/quicklook
mvn -Dglassfish.home=$GLASSFISH test
(where $GLASSFISH is a recent v3 build with the new jsf jars added in)

Engineering updates updatecenter2/conf/jsf_proto.py to correct version #. (ex: 2.0.1-0,1)

If doing a new maven release, be sure to update the pom.xml files in each demo directory.

Tag build.
Currently, we're using a tag format of
2.0.1-bXX - where "XX" is a monotonically increasing number, incremented with every build.
sample tagging command:
svn copy https://mojarra.dev.java.net/svn/mojarra/trunk \
         https://mojarra.dev.java.net/svn/mojarra/tags/2.0.1-b01 \
         -m "Tag 2.0.1 Build 01"

RE (Terena) promotes the build, with maven.deploy.promoted (ex: 2.0.1-b01)
Engineering needs to give RE the tag name, build.type, and build.number
RE changes variables found in common.xml (build.type, etc) via -D as part of build
    build.type will be set to a value such as BETA, RC, FCS, etc.
    build.number will be a monotonically increasing integer, incremented for each build (i.e., b01, b02)
After the push to maven, check (it can take a while to show up, up to 30 minutes)
http://download.java.net/maven/2/com/sun/faces/jsf-impl/
http://download.java.net/maven/2/com/sun/faces/jsf-api/


After testing, engineering integrates to v3, see integration instructions.
The integration pushes the new build bits to repine.

QE runs qualification tests against repine (current GFv3), comfirms they pass.

QE gives go-ahead.

For a release, RE will then do a maven.deploy.release for a released build (ex: 2.0.1)

Engineering then needs to once again integrate v3.


RELEASING TO JAVA.NET
=========================================
NOTE: we currently don't push every promoted build to java.net.  These instructions
      are for pushing a release to the public.  The steps above are valid in
      all cases.

 - Copy the downloaded binary and source bundles promoted from RE to a local
   directory.  These bundles are what will be made available to the public.
   (You can download them by ftp from rindge.sfbay.sun.com, cd to the provided directory
   (currently /net/jws-sparc.sfbay/bld1/BUILD_AREA/jsf2.0/bundles/latest), and then
   mget *)
 - Prepare release notes:
    + check out the website:  cvs -d :pserver:<j.net uid>@cvs.dev.java.net:/cvs co -P -d jsf-web javaserverfaces
    + if releasing a new patch release:
       * copy the directory structure of an existing version to the new version
         (e.g. rsync -r -C 1.2_12/* 1.2_13).  If this is another cut
       * replace the old version numbers with the new version numbers
       * update changelog.html with:
         - outline of new features (if any)
         - new context init parameters (if any - see older release notes for examples)
         - issues resolved
           + To get the list of issues, use the report tool to generate a report
             and gather a list of all issues resolved for this patch release
             (this may span several builds).  The table for the resolved
             issues should be two columns for the issue ID and description.
             Ensure the ID is a hyperlink.  I use a FireFox addon called
             Scrapbook to copy a selection of issues into a separate
             html document and then cut/paste into changelog.html.  Don't forget
             to update the row styles (again, see older changelogs for examples)
        * check in the new directory structure and files
     + if releasing an update to an existing version (i.e. 2.0.0 BETA1 to 2.0.0 BETA2)
       * update the version in the existing release notes
       * append the issues resolved between the two versions in changelog.xhtml
         (Use the 2.0.0 release notes for an example)
   - Upload the binary and source bundles to java.net.  The new directory
     should be placed under: Downloads->Release->Version
   - In the same directory, add a link that refers to the Release Notes (see
     previous versions for an example)
   - Update download.html:
     + If necessary move the version being replaced to Archived Releases
     + Add the new version using the existing format
   - Create a new download button for the new version using
     images/downloadbackground.png.  I use gimp to do the image manipulation.
     Add the new version to the template using Sans Bold font.  Adjust the
     font weight to fill the button.  Save the image as download<version>.png
     (e.g. download1212.png).  Check the image in to CVS.
   - Update index.html to reference the new download button.  Have the link
     the image refers to point to the folder containing the new build (should
     display the source, binary, and release notes).
   - Add a new announcement using the project's news facility.  Use existing
     announcements as a template.
   - Push the bits to maven (INSTRUCTIONS IN PROGRESS)
