This directory creates the following artifacts:

jsf2.0.nbm - Update Center Module for JSF 2.0
server.xml - XML Fragment for use in Update Center distro
descriptions.zip - Documentation pages used in Update Center distro

These three files need to be sent to the UC engineers for creating a UC entry.

Rajeshwar.Patil@sun.com is the current UC contact.

To create these entries for a promoted build, copy the jsf-impl.jar and 
jsf-api.jar files from the promoted build into the lib directory, then run 
the default target to create the dist directory.

To create these entries for a snapshot, just run "ant updatecenter" from the top
level directory.
