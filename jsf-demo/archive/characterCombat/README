This directory contains JavaServer (tm) Faces Character Combat demo source.

This file describes the web container requirements for running the demo
as well as instructions for building the demo.

Running the demo:

    - The pre-built war file containes JSTL 1.1 classes so you will
      need a JSTL 1.1 container to deploy the war file without any
      modifications.
    - In a JSTL 1.1 container, you can simply deploy the pre-built 
      war file available here:

      jsf-characterCombat/build/jsf-characterCombat.war

      - Some examples of containers that support JSTL 1.1 include:
        - Sun Java Systems Application Server 8.0 PE
        - Tomcat 5.x

    - The Character Combat demo will work in a JSTL 1.0 container but
      you will need to either:
        - replace the JSTL 1.1 jar files bundled in the pre-built
          war file with JSTL 1.0 jars
        -or-
        - Follow the "Building the demo" instructions for your environment
      - Some examples of containers that support JSTL 1.0 include:
        - SunOne Application Server 7.x
        - Tomcat 4.x


Building the demo:

Pre-requisites:
  - You will need the Ant build tool to build the demo

Building the demo:
  1) copy the build.properties.sample to build.properites
  2) edit the build.properties file and follow the instructions in the file
  3) the default target will build the demo. You can simply invoke "ant"
     in the same directory as the "build.xml" file like so:

     % ant

Debugging the build process:
  - if the build fails, most likely it is an environment problem. You can
    run the following ant task to verify that your build properties are
    set correctly:

    % ant props
