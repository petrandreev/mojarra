/**
 * <p>Render the individual {@link PaneComponent} and its children, but
 * <strong>only</strong> if this {@link PaneComponent} is currently
 * selected.  Otherwise, no output at all is sent.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>IMPLEMENTATION NOTE</strong> - Because of the fact that we
 * want standard JSP text (not nested inside Faces components) to be usable
 * on a pane, this Renderer needs to know whether it is being used in a JSP
 * environment (where the rendering of the child components writes to the
 * local value of our Pane component) or not (where we must do it ourselves).
 * This is resolved by having the <code>Pane_Tab</code> tag set a
 * render dependent attribute named "demo.renderer.TabRenderer.JSP" when it
 * creates the corresponding component, so that we can tell what is going on.
