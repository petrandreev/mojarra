                PENDING: Make all of this sound good
                This demo shows the unified EL of JavaServer Pages 2.1
                with the JavaServer Pages Standard Taglibrary version 1.2,
                and JavaServer Faces version 1.2.
                
                How it works:
                   - When the web application is initialized, the container will
                     invoke the InstallColorListener, ServletContextListener
                     which will register the ColorELResolver, a custom
                     ELResolver implementation with the JspApplicationContext.  
                     This ELResolver will handle the resolution of any 
                     \${Color.xxx} expressions within the JSP page.                                                                             
                   - Taking advantage of the installed ColorELResolver</a>,
                     the JSP page uses several \${Color.xxx} expressions to
                     specify various colors for the different elements of the 
                     page.  For more detail on how this works, see the 
                     getValue() method of the ColorELResolver.
                   - This demo makes use of &lt;c:forEach&gt; in conjunction
                     with JavaServer Faces components, which wasn't possible
                     with previous versions to render a small table
                     that displays some information about some books (NOTE 
                     the use of deferred expressions in c:forEach)
                </pre>
