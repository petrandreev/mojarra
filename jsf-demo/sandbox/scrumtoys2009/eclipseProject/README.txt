* See if it's possible remove all <navigation-rule> instances

* How does the error page work?

* Define how this should run on non EE6 containers.  What about BV?

* Log4j and JSTL ended up in WEB-INF/lib

* Non-existent documentation

* JavaDocs, remove @author javadocs.

* Remove README in WEB-INF

* Document how it runs on Tomcat with OpenEJB
