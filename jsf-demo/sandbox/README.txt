The demo sandbox directory is for all demos that are currently under development,
that may eventually be released at some time in the future as a demo.

Please do not move a demo out of the sandbox until it is ready for release to end users.

It is anticipated that some sandboxed demos may never be released - in that case, they should
either be moved to the archive directory (if they are useful for testing), or deleted.
