Demo application work flow analysis. 

The JSF Introductory Demo web application will be composed of four pages. Here is the page by page overview and work flow:

1) Main page:

	OVERVIEW:

	The main page will include instructions for the user. Something along the lines of:

	"Welcome to the JavaServer Faces Introductory Demo Application. With this application, you can pick your favorite Lord of the Rings characters or create your own. After picking your favorite characters you will find out which character can out magic the other without the benefit of The One Ring.

	A list of characters is presented on this page. If you would like to add your own, please do so in the input text field provided. Be sure to pick your character's background attributes. 

	When you are done you can go on to the next page."


	The main page as a table with a pre-populated set of elements. The table consists of Lord of the Rings characters and their specific attributes. 

	At the end of the table there is an open entry where the user can add a custom row to the table.

	At the bottom of the back there is a set of buttons: Back and Next. The Back button is disabled.


	WORK FLOW:

	The user can do the following:

	* Click Next without filling out any new character information
		* The 1st pick character page will be displayed with the default table values in read-only mode
	* Add a custom character and then clicking Next
		* If no character name given but pull down attributes modified a Validation error asking for character name should be displayed
		* The 1st pick character page will be displayed with the default table values and the custom character in read-only mode

	ARTICLE CONCEPTS (to mention in write-up about this page):

	- Main point: Display of tabular data
	- Adding custom data to model
	- Validation
	- Navigation
	- Headers and Footers (should probably talk about separately)
	- CSS

2) 1st pick page:

	OVERVIEW:

	The 1st pick page will include instructions for the user. Something along the lines of:

	"Please choose your first character that you would like to see in a magical battle."

	The 1st pick page displays the same table as the main page but the table is no longer editable. It also now has a set of checkboxes next to each entry row.

	The Back and Next buttons are enabled and available in the page footer.

	WORK FLOW:

	The user can do the following:

	* Click Next without selecting anything
		* Validation error message should be displayed asking the user to select a character
	* Select a checkbox and Click Next
		* The 2nd pick character page will be displayed
	* Select multiple checkboxes and Click Next
		* Validation error message should be displayed asking the user to select only one character
	* Click Back
		* The Main page will be displayed

	ARTICLE CONCEPTs: 

	- Main point: This page demonstrates how you can take the same model but display it in a different way.
	- Validation

3) 2nd pick page:

	OVERVIEW:

	The 2nd pick page will include instructions for the user. Something along the lines of:

	"Please choose your second character that you would like to see in a magical battle."

	The 2nd pick page differs from the 1st pick page in the fact that the 1st pick is not displayed in table entries.

	The Back and Next buttons are enabled and available in the page footer.

	WORK FLOW:

	The user can do the following:

	* Click Next without selecting anything
		* Validation error message should be displayed asking the user to select a character
	* Select a checkbox and Click Next
		* The Result page will be displayed
	* Select multiple checkboxes and Click Next
		* Validation error message should be displayed asking the user to select only one character
	* Click Back
		* The 1st pick page will be displayed

	ARTICLE CONCEPTs: 

	- Main point: This page demonstrates how you can take the same model but display it in yet another different way.
	- Validation

4) Result page:

	OVERVIEW:

	The Result page will display the result of pitting one character's magical abilities versus another character.

	The footer will have Back button. The Home button will replace the Next button.

	WORK FLOW:

	* Click Back
		* The 2nd pick page will be displayed
	* Click Home
		* The Main page will be displayed

	ARTICLE CONCEPTS:

	- Main point: this page is generated based on the user selection of the two characters and a logic algorithm.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Personal Notes:

Technical details:

	- the footer should look at the viewId to figure out where the user is at. This way the "Back" button can be disabled on the Main page. The "Home" button should replace the "Next" button on the results page. A common dynamic footer can thus be used throughout the application. A bit like templating.

	- suggested algorithm strategy to determine how a character "wins". Look at the species from highest to lowest:

	Maia -> Istari -> Ent -> Elf -> Man -> Dwarf -> Hobbit

	Same species match-ups result in a draw.
