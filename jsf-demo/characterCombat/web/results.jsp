  <h2>Combat Results Page</h2>

  <p>The results page determines the winner of the two selections
     based on a magically simple algorithm</p>

  <p>If 
     <i><h:outputText value="#{modelBean.firstSelection}" /></i>
     and 
     <i><h:outputText value="#{modelBean.secondSelection}" /></i>
     were to wage a magical war, the winner would be: 
     <b><h:outputText value="#{modelBean.combatWinner}" /></b>
     !
