============================================================ 
Building, Deploying And Running The Multiple Renderkits Demo
============================================================ 

REQUIREMENTS:

 - Mozilla browser with SVG support - FireFox - the demo uses
   XMLHttpRequest.
 - JSP 1.2 container

BUILDING:
 - See https://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/faq.html#Code_build

DEPLOYING:
 - For Glassfish:
       - autodeploy the war: copy jsf-demo/renderkits/build/jsf-renderkits.war to
             the <glassfish home>/domains/domain1/autodeploy directory.

RUNNING:
 - Fire up your browser and enter:
    http://<hostname>:<port>/jsf-renderkits
   where <hostName> is the host where the server is running
   and <port> is the port for requests.

KNOWN ISSUES:
 - Client side state saving appears to have problems.  Only part of the state
   is written to the page.  For now, make sure your web.xml setting is:
    <context-param>
        <param-name>javax.faces.STATE_SAVING_METHOD</param-name>
        <param-value>server</param-value>
    </context-param>
